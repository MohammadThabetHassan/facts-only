## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added
- Multilingual manipulation heuristics: Arabic, French and Spanish question-shaped
  headlines, Arabic "think tank / observatory" naming patterns (معهد، مرصد، مؤسسة،
  منتدى), and Arabic sponsored-content markers.
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (and `Retry-After` support) on
  rate-limit (429) and transient server errors from AI providers.
- Prompt-injection hardening: fetched page excerpts and analyzed answers are
  explicitly treated as untrusted data in every model prompt.
- Extension icons (16/32/48/128 px).
- Open-source scaffolding: MIT LICENSE, CI workflow (GitHub Actions),
  contributing guide, code of conduct, security policy, issue and PR templates.
- Docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`.

### Changed
- Established-publisher list is now explicitly cross-partisan (wire services,
  UN bodies, courts, academic venues, and established newspapers from different
  regions and editorial lines).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added
- Manifest V3 browser extension: verify selected text anywhere, one-click
  verification buttons on ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Perplexity, side-panel
  reports with history and Markdown export.
- Shared verification engine: claim extraction, independent search-grounded
  evidence hunt, GEO/content-farm source profiling, bias & framing analysis,
  deterministic trust signal.

  OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and an offline mock provider.
- Web app reusing the same engine (paste-text workflow).
- Offline smoke test suite (`node test/smoke.mjs`).
